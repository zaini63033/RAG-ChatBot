Material Accounting Policy Information\nThe Company adopted disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS practice statements 2 \u2018Making Ma-\nteriality Judgments\u2019) from 01 July, 2023. Although amendments did not result in any changes to the accounting policies them-\nselves, they impact the accounting policy information disclosed in the financial statements. The amendments require disclo-\nsure of \u2018material\u2019, rather than \u2018significant\u2019 accounting policies.\nThe material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies \nhave been consistently applied to all the periods presented except otherwise stated.\n4.1 Property and equipment\n(i) Owned assets\nProperty and equipment, except for freehold land, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and identified \nimpairment losses (if any). Freehold land is stated at cost less any identified impairment loss.\nDepreciation is charged by applying straight line method to write off the cost over the remaining useful life of the \nassets. Rates of depreciation are stated in note 6.1. Depreciation method, residual value and useful lives of assets \nare reviewed at least at each reporting date and adjusted if impact on depreciation is significant.\nDepreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use, i.e. when it is in the location and condition necessary \nfor it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Depreciation of an asset ceases when the \nasset is derecognized. Depreciation does not cease when the asset becomes idle or is retired from active use unless \nthe asset is fully depreciated.\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset\u2019s carrying amounts or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, \nonly when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the \ncost of the item can be measured reliably.\nThe carrying amount of property and equipment is removed from the statement of financial position upon scrapping \nor disposal or when no future economic benefit is expected from its use, scrapping or disposal.\nDay to day maintenance and normal repairs are charged to profit or loss as and when incurred. Gain or loss on \nscrapping or disposal of assets, if any, is charged to profit or loss. Gain or loss on disposal of assets is the difference \nbetween the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset disposed off.\n(ii) Right of use assets\nThe Company recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying \nasset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and \nidentified impairment losses, and adjusted for any re-measurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use \nassets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at \nor before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless the Company is reasonably certain to \nobtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated \nover the shorter of their estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are amortized over the useful \nlife of the assets using straight line method at the rates given in note 6.2. Amortization on additions begins when \nit is available for use, i.e. when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the \nmanner intended by management. Amortization of an asset ceases when the asset is derecognized. Right-of-use \nassets are also subject to impairment.\n(iii) Capital work in progress\nCapital work in progress is stated at cost less any identified impairment losses. It represents expenditure incurred \non property and equipment during construction and installation. Cost also includes applicable borrowing costs \nunder IAS 23. These expenditures are transferred to relevant assets\u2019 category as and when assets are available for use.\n4.2 Intangible assets\nResearch and software products development\nResearch costs are expensed as incurred. Software product development costs are expensed as incurred unless \ntechnical and commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, it is probable that future economic benefits will \nflow to the Company, the Company has an intention and ability to complete and use or sell the software and cost \ncan be measured reliably.\n99Annual Report 2024\n99Annual Report 2024"

The fair value of \noptions granted is determined at the grant date and is recognized as employee compensation expense on a straight \nline basis over the vesting period in profit or loss with corresponding credit to equity as employee compensation \nreserve. Fair value of options is arrived at using Black Scholes Pricing Model.\nWhen the options are exercised, the proceeds received equivalent to the face value of related shares is credited to \nshare capital and any amount above the share capital is credited to share premium account.\n4.6 Taxation\nProvision for current tax is based on taxable income for the year determined in accordance with the prevailing laws \nfor taxation of income. The charge for tax on income is calculated at the current rates of taxation as applicable after \ntaking into account tax credit and tax rebates available, if any. Income tax expense is recognized in statement of \nprofit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized \nin equity. Charge for tax expense also includes adjustments where necessary, relating to prior years which arise \nfrom assessments finalized during the current year.\nDeferred tax is accounted for using the statement of financial position method in respect of all temporary differences \narising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and \nthe corresponding tax bases used in the computation of the taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally \nrecognized for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is \nprobable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax \nlosses and tax credits can be utilized. Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply to the year \nwhen the differences reverse based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting \ndate. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the statement of profit or loss, except in the case of items credited or \ncharged to other comprehensive income in which case it is included in other comprehensive income.\nExpenses and assets are recognized net of the amount of sales tax, except:\n-  When the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, \nin which case, the sales tax is recognized as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense \nitem, as applicable. \n-  When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included the net amount of sales tax \nrecoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the \nstatement of financial position.\nIn accordance with the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, computation of final taxes is not based on taxable income. \nTherefore, as per IAS 12 Application Guidance on Accounting for Minimum Taxes and Final Taxes issued by the ICAP, \nthese fall within the scope of IFRIC 21 / IAS 37 and accordingly have been classified as levy in these unconsolidated \nfinancial statements, except for taxes on dividends on the Company\u2019s investments in subsidiaries and associates \nwhich are specifically within the scope of IAS 12 and hence, these continue to be categorised as current income tax.\n4.7 Trade and other payables\nLiabilities for trade and other payables are carried at cost which is the fair value of the consideration to be paid in \nfuture for goods and / or services received, whether or not billed to the Company.\nLiabilities for trade and other payable in foreign currency are revalued by applying the exchange rate applicable on \neach reporting date.\n4.8 Provisions and contingencies\nProvisions are recognized when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past \nevents and, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the \nobligation and reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and \nadjusted to reflect the current best estimate. Where outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is not \nprobable, a contingent liability is disclosed, unless the possibility of outflow is remote.\n4.9 Cash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and at current or saving accounts held with banks, fixed deposits \nand short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are \nsubject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. These also include facilities of running finance that form an \nintegral part of the Company\u2019s cash management.\n101Annual Report 2024\n101Annual Report 2024"

The initial subscription period is typically 12 \nto 60 months. The Company generally invoices its customers in advance in quarterly or annual installments and \ntypical payment terms provide that customers make payment within 120 days of invoice. Performance obligation \nagainst support  revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the support period, which in most instances is \none year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product updates, \nmaintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period on a when-and-if available basis. \nThe Company\u2019s customers purchase both product support and license updates when they acquire new software \nlicenses. In addition, a majority of customers renew their support services contracts annually and typical payment \nterms provide that customers make payment within 120 days of invoice.\nc) Professional services:\nPerformance obligation is satisfied and revenue from professional services is recognized over the time and typically \ncomprises implementation, development, customization, enhancements, data migration, training or other consulting \nservices. Consulting services are generally sold on a time-and-materials or fixed fee basis and can include services \nranging from software installation to data migration and building non-complex interfaces to allow the software \nto operate in integrated environments. The Company recognizes revenue from time-and-material arrangements \nas the services are performed.  In fixed fee arrangements, revenue is recognized as services are performed as \nmeasured by efforts incurred to date, compared to total estimated efforts to complete the services project. The \nmanagement applies judgment while estimating efforts to complete the services projects.  A number of internal \nand external factors can affect these estimates, including utilization and efficiency variances and specification \nand testing requirement changes.  Services are generally invoiced upon milestones as agreed in the contract and \npayments are typically due in 120 days after invoice.\nd) BPO services:\nRevenue from BPO services is recognized when earned. The Company recognizes revenue on issuance of billing to \nthe customer. Payment terms are upto 120 days after invoice.\ne) Miscellaneous income\nInterest on bank deposits is recognized and received on a time proportion basis on the principal amount outstanding \nand at the rate applicable.\nRental income is recognized on time proportion basis. Payment terms are 30 days.\nDividend is recognized as income when the right of receipt is established. Payment terms are 15 working days after \ndeclaration of dividend.\nMiscellaneous income is recognized on receipt basis, and is recognised in other income in statement of profit or loss.\nContract Modifications \nContract modifications involving changes in scope or price are treated as separate contracts if they add distinct \nperformance obligations at standalone prices. If not, they are either treated as a termination of the existing contract and \ncreation of a new one or, if no new distinct obligations arise, adjustments are made on a cumulative catch-up basis i.e. \nrecognizing in the current period the cumulative effect of changes on current and prior periods according to the revised \nperformance obligations.\nSignificant Judgments\nDue to the complexity of certain contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under IFRS 15 for the \nCompany\u2019s arrangements may be dependent on contract-specific terms and may vary in some instances.\nJudgment is required to determine the stand alone selling price (SSP) for each distinct performance obligation. The \nCompany rarely licenses or sells products on a stand-alone basis, so the Company is required to estimate the range \nof SSPs for each performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable because the Company \ndoes not sell the license, product or service separately, the Company determines the SSP using information that \nmay include market conditions and other observable inputs. In making these judgments, the Company analyzes \nvarious factors, including its pricing methodology and consistency, size of the arrangement, length of term, customer \ndemographics and overall market and economic conditions. Based on these results, the estimated SSP is set for \neach distinct product or service delivered to customers.\n103Annual Report 2024\n103Annual Report 2024"

When estimating variable consideration, the Company will consider all relevant facts and circumstances. \nVariable consideration will be estimated and included in the contract price only when it is probable that a significant \nreversal in the amount of revenue recognized will not occur.\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions\nThere are several practical expedients and exemptions allowed under IFRS 15 that impact timing of revenue \nrecognition and the Company\u2019s disclosures. Below is a list of practical expedients the Company applied in the \nadoption and application of IFRS 15:\na)  The Company does not evaluate a contract for a significant financing component if payment is expected \nwithin one year or less from the transfer of the promised items to the customer.\nb) The Company generally expenses sales commissions and sales agent fees when incurred when the \namortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing \nexpense in the statement of profit or loss.\nc)   The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts that have an \noriginal expected duration of one year or less.\nd)  The Group does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts for which the \nGroup recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed (applies \nto time-and-material engagements).\n4.11 Costs to obtain a contract\nThe Company does not have a material amount of costs to obtain a contract capitalized at any reporting date. In \ngeneral, the Company incurs few direct incremental costs for obtaining new customer contracts. We rarely incur \nincremental costs to review or otherwise enter into contractual arrangements with customers. In addition, our sales \npersonnel receive fees that we refer to as commissions, but that are based on more than simply signing up new \ncustomers. Our sales personnel are required to perform additional duties beyond signing of new deals, including \naccount management of customers and cash collection efforts.Notes to and forming part of the  \nFinancial Statements\nFor the Year Ended June 30, 2024\n104NETSOL Technologies Limited\n104NETSOL Technologies Limited"

The Company\u2019s \njudgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of \nconsideration to the distinct performance obligations, which could have an effect on results of operations for the \nperiods involved.\nIf a contract includes variable consideration, the Company exercises judgment in estimating the amount of \nconsideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a \ncustomer. When estimating variable consideration, the Company will consider all relevant facts and circumstances. \nVariable consideration will be estimated and included in the contract price only when it is probable that a significant \nreversal in the amount of revenue recognized will not occur.\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions\nThere are several practical expedients and exemptions allowed under IFRS 15 that impact timing of revenue \nrecognition and the Company\u2019s disclosures. Below is a list of practical expedients the Company applied in the \nadoption and application of IFRS 15:\na)  The Company does not evaluate a contract for a significant financing component if payment is expected \nwithin one year or less from the transfer of the promised items to the customer.\nb) The Company generally expenses sales commissions and sales agent fees when incurred when the \namortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing \nexpense in the statement of profit or loss.\nc)   The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts that have an \noriginal expected duration of one year or less.\nd)  The Group does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts for which the \nGroup recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed (applies \nto time-and-material engagements).\n4.11 Costs to obtain a contract\nThe Company does not have a material amount of costs to obtain a contract capitalized at any reporting date. In \ngeneral, the Company incurs few direct incremental costs for obtaining new customer contracts. We rarely incur \nincremental costs to review or otherwise enter into contractual arrangements with customers. In addition, our sales \npersonnel receive fees that we refer to as commissions, but that are based on more than simply signing up new \ncustomers. Our sales personnel are required to perform additional duties beyond signing of new deals, including \naccount management of customers and cash collection efforts.Notes to and forming part of the  \nFinancial Statements\nFor the Year Ended June 30, 2024\n104NETSOL Technologies Limited\n104NETSOL Technologies Limited\n4.12 Contract assets\nA contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for services transferred to the customer. If the Company \nhas satisfied the performance obligation, either in full or partially, by transferring services to a customer before the \ninvoice is issued or payment is due, a contract asset is recognized for the earned consideration that is conditional.\n4.13 Trade receivables\nA receivable represents the Company\u2019s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the \npassage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Refer to accounting policies of financial \nassets in section 4.17 (i) Financial instruments \u2013 initial recognition and measurement.\n4.14 Contract liabilities\nA contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received \nconsideration from the customer in advance or an amount of consideration is due. If a customer pays consideration \nbefore the Company transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognized when the amount \nis received or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when the \nCompany performs under the contract.\n4.15 Related party transactions\nThe Company enters into transactions with related parties at an arm\u2019s length basis. Prices for transactions with \nrelated parties are determined using admissible valuation methods, except in extremely rare circumstances where, \nsubject to approval of the Board of Directors, it is in the best interest of the Company to do so.\n4.16 Off-setting of financial instruments\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the financial statements only when \nthere is legally enforceable right to set-off the recognized amount and the Company intends either to settle on a \nnet basis, or to realize the assets and to settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n4.17 Financial instruments\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or \nequity instrument of another entity.\n(i) Financial assets\nInitial recognition and measurement\nFinancial assets are classified, at initial recognition, and subsequently measured at amortized cost, fair value \nthrough other comprehensive income (OCI), and fair value through profit or loss.\nThe classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset\u2019s contractual cash flow \ncharacteristics and the Company\u2019s business model for managing them.\nThe Company initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus transaction cost. In the case of a financial \nasset not at fair value through profit or loss at its fair value.\nSubsequent measurement\nFor purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:\n- Financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments)\n- Financial assets at fair value through OCI with recycling of cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments)\n- Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon\n   derecognition (equity instruments)\n- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\nDerecognition\nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is \nprimarily derecognized (i.e., removed from the Company\u2019s statement of financial position) when rights to receive \ncash flows from the asset have expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all \nrisks and rewards of ownership.\n105Annual Report 2024\n105Annual Report 2024"

At subsequent reporting date, recoverable amounts are \nestimated to determine the extent of impairment loss, if any, and carrying amount of investment is adjusted \naccordingly. Impairment losses are recognized as expense in the statement of profit or loss. Where impairment \nloss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amounts of investment are increased to its revised recoverable amount, \nlimited to the extent of initial cost of investment. Reversal of impairment losses are recognized in the statement \nof profit or loss.\nb) Investment in associates\nAn associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to \nparticipate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over \nthose policies.\nThe considerations made in determining significant influence are similar to those necessary to determine control \nover subsidiaries. The Company\u2019s investment in its associate is accounted for using the equity method.\nUnder the equity method, investment in an associate is initially recognized at cost. The carrying amount of the \ninvestment is adjusted to recognize changes in the Company\u2019s share of net assets of the associate since the \nacquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not \ntested for impairment separately.\nThe statement of profit or loss reflects the Company\u2019s share of the results of operations of the associate. Any change \nin other comprehensive income of those investees is presented as part of the Company\u2019s other comprehensive \nincome. In addition, when there has been a change recognized directly in the equity of the associate, the Company \nrecognizes its share of any changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity.\nThe financial statements of the associate or joint venture are prepared for the same reporting period as the \nCompany, unless otherwise stated. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line \nwith those of the group.\nThe Company periodically determines whether it is necessary to recognize any impairment loss on its investment \nin its associate or not. The Company determines on annual basis whether there is any objective evidence that the \ninvestment in associate is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Company calculates the amount of impairment \nas the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, and then recognizes the \nloss within \u2018Share of profit or loss of an associate\u2019 in the statement of profit or loss.\nUpon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Company measures and recognizes any retained investment \nat its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of significant influence and \nthe fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognized in profit or loss.\n5. Summary Of Other Accounting Policies\n5.1 Lease liabilities\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Company recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value \nof lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-\nsubstance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or \na rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The variable lease payments that do not \ndepend on an index or a rate are recognized as expense in the period on which the event or condition that triggers \nthe payment occurs.\nIn calculating the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease \ncommencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement \ndate, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease \npayments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is re-measured if there is a modification, a \nchange in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to \npurchase the underlying asset.\n107Annual Report 2024\n107Annual Report 2024"

Lease \npayments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis \nover the lease term.\nSignificant judgement in determining the lease term of contracts with renewal & termination options\nThe Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered \nby an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to \nterminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.\nThe Company applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew or \nto terminate the lease.

Contingencies and Commitments\n28.1 Contingencies\nMr. Ahsan Zubair, an ex-employee of the Company has filed a case for recovery of damages dated January 26, 2013 \nfor malicious prosecution before the Honourable Civil Court, Lahore and has sought damages to the tune of Rs. \n500 million. The case was filed five years after a complaint lodged by NetSol Technologies Limited with Federal \nInvestigation Authority pertaining to use of NetSol\u2019s IP without authority by a company formed by the employee \nand his partner who was also an ex-employee of the Company. Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of \nthe case, including the nature of evidence of the plaintiff and the laws applicable, it can safely be inferred that, \non merits, no case for damages is made out. This is also endorsed by the fact that the case is barred by the laws \nrelating to limitation. Moreover none of the ingredients forming basis for allowing a case of malicious prosecution \nare attracted. In the opinion of the legal advisor, the outcome of the case is expected in favour of the Company, \nhence, no provision is incorporated in these financial statements.\n28.2 Commitments\nBank guarantees have been issued amounting to Rs. 60.93 million (2023: Rs. 36.21 million) against performance of \nvarious contracts, to LESCO and to Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Limited against its corporate credit cards.\nThe Company has capital commitments of Rs 1.32 million as at June 30, 2024 (2023: Nil).\n121Annual Report 2024\n121Annual Report 2024"

The Company is not exposed to significant other price risk.\n(b) Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer \ncontract, leading to a financial loss. Credit risk of the Company arises from trade debts, loans and advances, trade \ndeposits, other receivables and deposits with banks.  To reduce exposure to credit risk, the Company has developed \na formal approval process. The management assesses the credit quality of the customers, taking into account their \nfinancial position, past experience and other factors and makes provision against those balances (if required). The \nutilization of credit limits is regularly monitored. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated \nparties with a strong credit rating are accepted.\nThe Company monitors the credit quality of its financial assets with reference to historical performance of such \nassets and available external credit ratings, if any. As at June 30, 2024, the maximum exposure to credit risk is equal \nto the carrying amount of the financial assets as detailed below:\nThe Company does not have significant exposure to any individual customer. At June 30, the Company had 31 \ncustomers owing Rs. 5.58 billion. The Company has made allowances, where necessary, for potential losses on \ncredits extended.\nFor trade receivables and contract assets, the Company uses a simplified approach to calculate expected credit \nlosses (ECLs). A provision matrix has been established based on the Company\u2019s historical credit loss experience, \nadjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. This matrix is based on \nthe segments that exhibit similar patterns, such as geography and customer type.\nThe management estimates the recoverability of trade receivables on the basis of financial position and past \nhistory of its customers based on the objective evidence that it may not receive the amount due from the particular \ncustomer.

        "content": "The Company has no instruments subject to fixed interest rate. \nCash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments\nAs at June 30, 2024, if floating interest rates had been 1% higher / lower with all other variables held constant, profit \nbefore tax for the year would have been lower / higher by Rs. 7.74  million (2023: Rs. 3.75 million), mainly as a result \nof interest exposure on variable rate borrowings.\n(iii) Other price risk\nOther price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of \nchanges in market prices (other than those arising from currency risk or interest rate risk), whether those changes \nare caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting all similar \nfinancial instruments traded in the market. The Company is not exposed to significant other price risk.\n(b) Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer \ncontract, leading to a financial loss. Credit risk of the Company arises from trade debts, loans and advances, trade \ndeposits, other receivables and deposits with banks.  To reduce exposure to credit risk, the Company has developed \na formal approval process. The management assesses the credit quality of the customers, taking into account their \nfinancial position, past experience and other factors and makes provision against those balances (if required). The \nutilization of credit limits is regularly monitored. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated \nparties with a strong credit rating are accepted.\nThe Company monitors the credit quality of its financial assets with reference to historical performance of such \nassets and available external credit ratings, if any. As at June 30, 2024, the maximum exposure to credit risk is equal \nto the carrying amount of the financial assets as detailed below:\nThe Company does not have significant exposure to any individual customer. At June 30, the Company had 31 \ncustomers owing Rs. 5.58 billion. The Company has made allowances, where necessary, for potential losses on \ncredits extended.\nFor trade receivables and contract assets, the Company uses a simplified approach to calculate expected credit \nlosses (ECLs). A provision matrix has been established based on the Company\u2019s historical credit loss experience, \nadjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. This matrix is based on \nthe segments that exhibit similar patterns, such as geography and customer type.\nThe management estimates the recoverability of trade receivables on the basis of financial position and past \nhistory of its customers based on the objective evidence that it may not receive the amount due from the particular \ncustomer. The provision is written off by the Company when it expects that it cannot recover the balance due. Any \nsubsequent repayments in relation to amounts written off are credited directly to profit or loss.

The Company follows an effective cash management and \nplanning process to ensure availability of funds and to take appropriate actions for new requirements.
